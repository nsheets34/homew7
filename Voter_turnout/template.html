    <h1>Homework 7: Voter Turnout Choropleth Map</h1>
    <h2>Nicholas Sheets</h2>
    <h3> This choropleth map was made to show voter turnout by state for each of the states in the union. This map utilized the
        equal break classification scheme, which allows each color area to have roughly equal representation, in order to easily 
        show the audience groups of similar states. This map will allow us to see which states have high and lower turnout, 
        which could allow politicians and advocates to look at why certain groups of states have higher turnouts compared to others
        and introduce ideas to raise turnout in states with lower participation (polling locations, resources, public awareness, 
        voting laws, etc.).
